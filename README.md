You'll have to ignore some of the questionable naming conventions, but multiple versions/updates of my code are here; in the 'old version' folder as well as my final version (incomplete) which is in the main directory.

I've made use of the appJar library as well as sqlite3 for my GUI and database in the program. I had never used either before, so I had to learn how to use them and they proved to be useful.
